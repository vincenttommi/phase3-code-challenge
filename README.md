# Object Relations Code Challenge - Articles

For this assignment, you will be working with a Magazine domain.

We have three models: `Author`, `Article`, and `Magazine`.

For our purposes, an `Author` has many `Article`s, a `Magazine` has many `Article`s, and `Article`s belong to both `Author` and `Magazine`.

`Author` - `Magazine` is a many to many relationship.

**Note**: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard _before you start coding_. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.

## Topics

- Classes and Instances
- Class and Instance Methods
- Variable Scope
- Object Relationships
- lists and list Methods

## Instructions

To get started, run `pipenv install` while inside of this directory.

Build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. The methods are listed in a suggested order, but you can feel free to tackle the ones you think are easiest. Be careful: some of the later methods rely on earlier ones.

**Remember!** This code challenge does not have tests. You cannot run `pytest`. You'll need to create your own sample instances so that you can try out your code on your own. Make sure your relationships and methods work in the console before submitting.

We've provided you with a tool that you can use to test your code. To use it, run `python tools/debug.py` from the command line. This will start a `ipdb` session with your classes defined. You can test out the methods that you write here. You can add code to the `tools/debug.py` file to define variables and create sample instances of your objects.

Writing error-free code is more important than completing all of the deliverables listed - prioritize writing methods that work over writing more methods that don't work. You should test your code in the console as you write.

Similarly, messy code that works is better than clean code that doesn't. First, prioritize getting things working. Then, if there is time at the end, refactor your code to adhere to best practices. When you encounter duplicated logic, extract it into a shared helper method.

**Before you submit!** Save and run your code to verify that it works as you expect. If you have any methods that are not working yet, feel free to leave comments describing your progress.

## Deliverables

Write the following methods in the classes in the files provided. Feel free to build out any helper methods if needed.


Some of the methods listed are provided to you in the starter code. You should check that they work correctly, and that you understand them.

### Initializers, Readers, and Writers

#### Author
init__(name)`
  - An author is initialized with a name, as a string.
  - A name **cannot** be changed after it is initialized.
- `Author name()`
  - Returns the name of the author
- `Author __i

#### Magazine

- `Magazine __init__(name, category)`
  - A magazine is initialized with a name as a string and a category as a string
  - The name and category of the magazine **can be** changed after being initialized.
- `Magazine name()`
  - Returns the name of this magazine
- `Magazine category()`
  - Returns the category of this magazine
- `Magazine all()`
  - Returns an list of all Magazine instances

#### Article

- `Article __init__(author, magazine, title)`
  - An article is initialized with an author as an Author object, a magazine as a Magazine object, and title as a string.
  - An article **cannot** change its author, magazine, or title after it is has been initialized.
- `Article title()`
  - Returns the title for that given article
- `Article all()`
  - Returns an list of all Article instances

### Object Relationship Methods

#### Article

- `Article author()`
  - Returns the author for that given article
- `Article magazine()`
  - Returns the magazine for that given article

#### Author

- `Author articles()`
  - Returns an list of Article instances the author has written
- `Author magazines()`
  - Returns a **unique** list of Magazine instances for which the author has contributed to

#### Magazine

- `Magazine contributors()`
  - Returns an list of Author instances who have written for this magazine

### Associations and Aggregate Methods

#### Author

- `Author add_article(magazine, title)`
  - Given a magazine (as Magazine instance) and a title (as a string), creates a new Article instance and associates it with that author and that magazine.
- `Author topic_areas()`
  - Returns a **unique** list of strings with the categories of the magazines the author has contributed to

#### Magazine

- `Magazine find_by_name(name) class method`
  - Given a string of magazine's name, this method returns the first magazine object that matches
- `Magazine article_titles() class method`
  - Returns an list strings of the titles of all articles written for that magazine
- `Magazine contributing_authors()`
  - Returns an list of authors who have written more than 2 articles for the magazine
